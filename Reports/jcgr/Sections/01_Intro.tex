\section{Introduction}
\label{01}

This report is the result of a project in the Game Engines E2013 (MGAE-E2013) course on the Games line at the IT-University of Copenhagen autumn 2013. 

For the project, I have worked with Jakob Melnyk (jmel) to create a plugin for Unity that allows the user to gather data for their games and create heat maps based on this data.

Throughout this report I will be referring to two games, in which we have tested the plugin: AngryBots which is a demo project for Unity and Hiaerth which is a game we have created for the Game Design course\footnote{The entire Unity project can be found at https://github.com/esfdk/DarkForest}.
