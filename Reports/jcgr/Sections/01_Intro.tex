\section{Introduction}
\label{Introdution}

This report is the result of a project in the Game Engines E2013 (MGAE-E2013) course on the Games line at the IT-University of Copenhagen autumn 2013. 

For the project, I have worked with Jakob Melnyk (jmel) to create a plug-in for Unity that allows the user to gather data for their games and create heat maps based on this data.
