\section{The Plugin}
\label{Plugin}

With the features described in section \ref{Project_Features}, we started working on the heat mapping tool. We started with very basic tracking and visualizing, and built it up from there. In the end, the plugin ended up being able to gather data for any event on an object. The gathered data is stored in an XML file and can be used inside Unity to create a basic heat map for the game.

The plugin can, by default, track some default Unity events such as the position of an object. Furthermore, one can track custom events, allowing the developers to gather virtually any kind of data they want. The heat map generation will take the custom events into account, and allow generation of heat maps of the custom events.

\refFig{H_01} shows a part of a heat map generated by the plugin for the game Hiraeth. The heat map is of decent quality, and clearly shows where the player has been walking, and in which places they spent more time than in others.
