\section{Overview of the Plugin}
\label{03}

With the features described in section \ref{02_02}, we started working on the heat mapping tool. We started with very basic tracking and visualizing, and built it up from there. In the end, the plugin ended up being able to gather data for any event on an object. The gathered data is stored in an XML file and can be used inside Unity to create a basic heat map for the game.

The plugin can, by default, track some default Unity events such as the position of an object. Furthermore, one can track custom events, allowing the developers to gather virtually any kind of data they want. The heat map generation will take the custom events into account, and allow generation of heat maps of the custom events.

As seen in \refFig{H_01}, the heat map overlay generated by the plugin is of a decent quality, and certainly good enough to learn something about the players' behaviour from. As one can see, the player just walked around until they got to something interesting, at which point they stayed for a little while, investigating it.
