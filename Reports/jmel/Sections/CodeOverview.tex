\section{Overview of the Plug-in}
\label{CO}
The plug-in consists of eight scripts (six behaviour scripts, two editor scripts), two prefabs and one external plug-in (consisting of two scripts). 

\subsection{Folder structure}
\label{CO_FStructure}
The plug-in contains four folders:
\begin{my_enumerate}
\item [\textit{Editor}] contains custom editor menues for the two of the scripts in the plug-in.
\item [\textit{Plugins}] contains two scripts from an external plug-in.
\item [\textit{Prefabs}] contains two prefab objects used in the plug-in.
\item [\textit{Scripts}] contains the scripts for the main logic of the plug-in.
\end{my_enumerate}

\subsection{Prefabs}
\label{CO_Prefabs}
The plug-in uses two prefabs to render heat maps. The \textit{HM\_HeatMarker} is used for marking event positions and the density/heat of these positions in the heat map. The \textit{HM\_HeatMap} is essentially an empty game object with the \textit{HM\_GenerateHeatMap} script attached.

\subsection{HM\_Event & HM\_EventTypes}
\label{CO_Event}

\subsection{Editor scripts}
\label{CO_Editor}
The two editor scripts change the appearance of the \textit{HM\_GenerateHeatMap} and \textit{HM\_Tracker} by adding drop-down lists to select data files, toggle options for tracked events and buttons for generating and clearing the heat map.
\subsection{External plug-in}
\label{CO_PlugIn}
The external plug-in is only used for a smooth colour transition on based on the density. The plug-in is called \footnote{Source: ColourX package http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Colorx}.
