\section{Introduction}
\label{Intro}
This report is the result of the final project in the Game Engines E2013 (MGAE-E2013) course at the IT-University of Copenhagen, autumn 2013. 

The aim of this project was to create a Unity\footnote{http://unity3d.com/} plug-in that allows the user to track events in their game and generate a heat map based on this event data.

On this project I collaborated with Jacob Grooss (jcgr@itu.dk) on writing the plug-in and testing the performance.
